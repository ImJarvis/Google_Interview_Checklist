# Google_Interview_Checklist
This is a repo for prep material for all the information I gathered while preparing for Tech Giant.

I am spliting my prepration in 3 parts. 
1) Discrete Mathematics
2) Data Structure
3) Algorithm

For algorithm I have decided to Follow Skiena's Materials -
Lecture which i am following-

Along with that i have bought his book Algorithm Design Manual ( Download it from the repo)

Presentation used in the above tutorials can be downloded from following link -

For Discrete mathematics - Here is a Quora answer on books recommendation and how to approach towards it.
Since from interview point of view, we need not to spend more depth first approach rather we should approach Discrete in Breadth First approach. This is a good answer to start up your prep ( will be adding books to download asap) -
